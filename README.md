{
    "token": "PASTE YOUR TOKEN HERE"
}
```

```

Wait a few seconds till you see this output in terminal. :

Currently Logged in as: BOT NAME
Client ID: 123456789
```

The bot should be started. Use `!?setup` to start the setup.

## Hosting

To keep the bot online 24/7, You need to host your bot. This task can be done on your computer but you'll have to keep your PC on 24/7 which is difficult for majority of users. There are many options to host like buying a VPS though here are some options that are recommended for majority of users.

#### Free (But Limited):
[Heroku](https://heroku.com) is a free option but your bot will stay online for 20-22 days in a month. Every month, you get free dynos which will restart your bot again.

If you add a credit card to Heroku (No need to pay anything, Just add a card). Your bot will stay online 24/7 with no downtime.

#### Paid (But Cheap):
[SomethingHost](https://something.host) is another option and is the recommended one. The cheapest plan of Discord Bot Hosting package will be perfect for you.
